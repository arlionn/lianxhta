# OK-B891-林芷涵：medoutcon-中介效应之路径分析-R语言

- What's medoutcon?
  - The `medoutcon` R package provides facilities for efficient estimation of path-specific (in)direct effects that measure the impact of a treatment variable $A$ on an outcome variable $Y$, through a direct path (through $A$ only) and an indirect path (through a set of mediators $M$ only).
